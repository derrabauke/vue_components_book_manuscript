# Introduction

## Welcome

Vue.js is a progressiv web framework for building user interfaces. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable and
therefore easy to pick up in existing projects. But, on the other hand capable of powering sophisticated applications.

This book assumes that the reader has some basic unterstanding of Vue.js. It builds on that knowledge to give the reader
a deeper unterstanding of the Vue.js component model and discusses advanced component patterns.

If you have already heard of Vue.js scoped lots, renderless components or high order components but were unsure when or how
to use these concepts, you are in the right place here!

If you dont' know your way around Vue.js yet, I can highly recommmend the official [Vue.js guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html).
But, please don't be afraid of diving right into this book with me. I will point you to the relevant official documentation in
the various chapters to give you some more background and a chance to read up on some more background material.

Many concepts introduced in this book have similar occurences in other web frameworks as for example React or Angular. If you
have experience in either one of these, you will be delighted to learn that all your existing knowledge can be easily applied
to Vue.js too.

## Tooling and Code Examples

All example code can be found in the public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fdietz/vue_components_book_examples) accompanying the book.

## Structure

Chapter 2 will start with a high level introduction of components and their properties. I will provide the mental model for all
the upcoming chapters.

In chapter 2 we will discuss the Vue.js concept of `slots` and `scoped slots`. This chapter alone will let you tremendously
model your application code differently by using component composition.

Chapter 3 discusses the difference between Vue.js `scoped slots` and render props.

Chapter 4 will introduce you to High Order components and will give you yet another possibility of composing your components
in a functional approach.
